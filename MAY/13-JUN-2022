#1. What/Which type of webservice are you working on or are you developing?
Working on 
WS-I organization
	|-BP1.0 specification
		|-jaxprc api
			|-jaxrpc si implementation (or)
			|-apache axis
			|-oracle weblogic server webservice 
			|-ibm websphere server webservice 
	|-BP.1.1 specification
		|-jaxws api
			|-jaxws ri implementation
			|-apache axis2
			|-apache cxf
			|-oracle weblogic server webservice 
			|-ibm websphere server webservice 
			
#2. which endpoint based web service are you developing?
There are 2 endpoint based webservices are there
1. servlet endpoint
if the incomming request that is send by the consumer is received by an servlet at the provider end, then it is called "Servlet Endpoint" based webservice
2. ejb endpoint 
if the incoming request is received by an ejb at the provider side, then it is called ejb endpoint based web service

Many of the times we build web services based on servlet-endpoint only, rather than using ejb endpoint

Why not ejb, why would we prefer servlet-endpoint based web services?
1. an ejb with webservice becomes very complex technology to develop
2. even we develop webservices using ejb endpoint, there is no added advantage since non of the cross-platform features that comes out of ejb cannot be used in building web services, because it makes webservices non-interoperable
