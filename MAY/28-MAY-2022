There are 2 types of operations are there
1. one-time operations
	1.1 xjc
	1.2 schemagen
	
2. runtime operations
	2.1 Marshalling
	2.2 UnMarshalling
	2.3 In-Memory Validation
	

JAXBContext
There are 2 purposes JAXBContext serves
1. it acts as factory for creating the object of Marshaller/UnMarshaller classes
2. it acts as context for holding the Binding classes in the memory, so that unmarshaller/marshaller can quickly locate the binding classes from the memory itself.
	

JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance("org.lic.insurance.types");
// this loads all the binding classes from the specified package and keeps in memory
UnMarshaller unmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnMarshaller();
JAXBElement<PolicyType> jaxbElement =  unmarshaller.unmarshal(new File("policy.xml"));
PolicyType policyType = jaxbElement.getValue();
