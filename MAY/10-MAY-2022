include
to encourage modularity we can break an xsd into multiple xsds and we can include one xsd inside the another one when both of them has the same namespace

import
to reuse the xsd provided by third-party or external provides within our xsd where the namespaces are different, then we use import
	
w3c.org people has defined the structure of an xsd document in another xsd which has the namespace www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema, so while referring the elements of the xsd we need to use qualified name, so we assign the shortname for the above namespace and use qualified names of xsd elements as below.
	
<xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
</xsd:schema>
