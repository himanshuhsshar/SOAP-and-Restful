Why soap services/restful services are introduced, when we have ejb technology in place to build distributed components/solutions?
Using Ejb technology we can build distributed applications/components, but these components are accessible only to the other applications that are build-in java language only.
In order to make our distributed component accessible across the network irrespective of technology and platform of the other application, we need to use soap/restful services technology

Soap Web Services / Restful Services is a technology used for building distributed components which are even interoperable as well. So we build inter-operable distributed solutions using soap/restful service technologies.

1. What is distributed technology? What is the purpose of it?
2. What are the factors influence us in building distributed technology based applications?
3. How does the applications looks like when we build them using distributed technology, what is the nature of them?
4. Evolution of distributed technology?
5. What is the support of programming languages toward distributed technology?
6. What is the support of java programming language in working on distributed technology?
