EJB
----
Ejb stands for enterprise java beans, it is an api provided for building enterpriese distributed applications

There are 3 types of Ejb are there
1. Session Bean = distributing business logic over the network
2. Entity Bean = to expose persistence logic over the network
3. Message-Driven Bean = To build distributed components, that can communicate by exchanging messages between them. asynchronous communication support

RMI doesnt support building enterprise class-level distributed components, all the cross-platform services like security, memory management, high-availability, transactionlity, concurrency, resource maangement has to be taken care by the developer by writing the code.
	
To overcome the dis-advantage with RMI the sun microsystems has introduced EJB technology that takes care of cross-platform services required in building enterprise class level distributed applications
