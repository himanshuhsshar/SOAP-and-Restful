How to develop Apache Cxf based provider?
jaxws api
|-apache cxf
	|-contract-first approach
	|-servlet endpoint
	|-sync req/reply
	|-document-literal
	
#1. write the wsdl document
#2. generate binding classes
The apache cxf implementation vendor has to provide tools for generating the binding classes
There are 2 different tools provided for generating the binding classes
1. java2wsdl
2. wsdl2java

|-wsdl document
wsdl2java
 | -o src\main\java
   -fe JAXWS21
	 -b jaxb

wsdl2java
|-sei
|-implementation
|-input/output classes
|-binding classes (jaxb)
	
3. write implements class with business logic
4. configure it as an jaxws:endpoint in spring bean configuration file #application-context.xml
5. configure CXFServlet & ContextLoaderListener in web.xml
